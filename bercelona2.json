  "neighborhood_overview": "Poble Sec is located just next the mountain of Montjuic, not to be missed for its several museums (Miró Foundation, MNAC, Caixafòrum, Ethnological Museum, Archaeology Museum, etc.), the Olympic Ring, the Castle and the cableway, its wonderful views of Barcelona and for being a green escape to the bustle of the city (and to heat in summer). The area is very well supplied: supermarket right in front of the apartment, the best artisan bakery in the neighbourhood just next door, two butchers (one of them organic), fish shop, drugstore, banks and playground for children, all just within a 100 meters radius (more facilities a bit farther). The neighbourhood is a lively and trendy one, with plenty of cafés, bars, restaurants, theatres and concert halls to enjoy the city from breakfast to evening, either alone, in couple, with friends or with kids.",

The building is in a residential (read: non-touristy) part of Spain so if you are looking for a real taste of local culture this is the place to stay. 2 blocks from the subway and we were downtown in just a couple stops. The apartment is in building with a common courtyard (common for the style). The other people that live in the building were very friendly and helpful answering any questions we had. My son was even able to play with the other children (despite the language barrier). Awesome experience -- would definietly rent again."

The neighborhood is well situated - it is not at all touristy but close to transportation at Plaza España and Poble Sec metro stops so you can easily get to all the places you want to visit. We stayed here for 3 nights with our two children and found it perfect. We were able to walk or take the metro everywhere we wanted to go, but have a quieter place to sleep and relax. There is a park down the street and a supermarket directly across. Xavi met us on arrival and was very nice and helpful throughout our stay. When my husband accidentally left a few things in the apartment, Xavi collected them and met us upon our return to Barcelona a few days later to return them. Thanks, Xavi! It was a great stay in Barcelona and I would definitely recommend the apartment to anyone looking for space and comfort in a close but quieter neighborhood. "

The duplex was very nice and spacious, clean, charming, outfitted with everything we needed, with comfortable beds and a very nice kitchen (with an induction cooktop!).  The property is older and there was some remodeling noise for a few hours from the neighboring apartment, which we could hear through what seemed to be a shared skylight, but it was very brief and not a concern (unless noise privacy is a very high priority, which it wasn't for us).  We didn't even use the third bedroom with bunk beds, but it would be ideal for a family.  The metro was close enough, and the bakery just downstairs, together with the grocery store literally across the street, were a wonderful convenience.  We went nearly everywhere by metro, and the location was central enough that at the end of the day, if we were too tired to make our way back by metro, an easy cab ride back to the apartment never exceeded 8 euros (which would've been the cost of the metro for all four of us anyway).  Overall, the apartment was a nice, comfortable bargain for family travel - not the most modern, but charming and fully met our needs."

Very well positioned to walk to Rambla, beach/harbours/ Mont Juic. Clear instructions how to get there. Parking available in the street which is free in the month of August. Otherwise it is approx Euro 2.5 per hr, max 2hrs on the street. There is private, secure parking at Euro 40 per 24hrs or you can park for free at the university and metro back to Poble Sec. "

    "comments": "Yes we were welcomed nicely by Yamila.  Other than how to work the stove top, her information was very good. The space suited us very  well. Enough beds  for all 4 of us. Other than the top of the staircase being very dangerous, we were very comfortable   The neighbourhood was fine.  A convenience store right across the street is fabulous. We found several good restaurants nearby as well. We used the hop on hop off system for our 2 day stay rather than the metro and with a couple of cab rides to pick- up points , we managed very well & really liked being above ground to see the sights rather than in a subway.

Sheets and towels were provided. Everything was clean. Wi-fi works good.\r\nOne of the 3 rooms doesn’t have curtains and the light wakes you up early in the morning.\r\nThe apartment is located close to the metro Poble Sec (150m), so it is easy to get to the center or the train station quite fast (10-15 min). You can also get to the center by foot (25-30 min). You can find some restaurants in the neighbourhood that are clearly cheaper than in the center.\r\nThere is also a supermarket just across the street and a bakery not far.\r\nA really nice, spacious and quiet place to stay for a visit of the town. Not too far from the center and the proximity of the metro is really convenient.\r\nHosts are really nice and accommodating. Thank you !"

Der Austausch mit Cristina und Yamila im Vorfeld verlief schnell und reibungslos. \r\nDie Wohnung ist mit allem ausgestattet, bis auf eine Spülmaschine.\r\nSitzen im Patio oder auf der Terrasse im 1. Stock mit einem schönen Glas Wein oder morgens zum Frühstück ist klasse.\r\nWenn wir erneut nach Barcelona fahren, kommen wir gern wieder.\r\nDas Viertel ist sehr angenehm und alle Einkaufsmöglichkeiten schnell zu erreichen. V.a. lokaler Bäcker im Nachbarhaus und Metzger einige Häuser weiter sind zu empfehlen.\r\nAuch die Nachbarn sind sehr freundlich. Einige von ihnen feiern gern bis spät in die Nacht. Bei offenen Fenstern lässt sich dann nur mit Stöpseln schlafen. Aber die Wohnung ist sicher eine der ruhigeren Unterkünfte in Barcelona.\r\nUnserer Meinung nach ist die Wohnung ideal für 3-4 Personen oder eine Familie mit Kindern. Es gibt einen Raum mit einem KingSize Bett, ein Kinderzimmer für 2. Der dritte Raum ist für eine Person gut geeignet, ist zur Treppe in der Wohnung nur mit einem Vorhang getrennt und hat ein Dachfenster.\r\nHerzlichen Dank nochmal an die lieben Gastgeber\r\n"

Yamila let us into the apartment and answered any questions we had. The apartment is perfectly situated near a metro stop with easy access to anything you would want to see or do in Barcelona. There are great places to eat nearby and a small supemarket, pastry shop, butcher, fresh fish place, and a general store sort of place all on the same street. There are some great and friendly neighbors as well. There is a nice outdoor eating place off the kitchen. All the basics are covered and we were able to make meals in the apartment without any issues. Took us a minute to figure out the stovetop but after finding the instructions in English online we realized if it was blinking at us there wasn't enough weight and we needed to move the pot or pan to a smaller eye. We had a problem with the washing machine and called Xavi who was accommodating and over within an hour to check it out. He also collected the keys our last day and was as easy and wonderful to work with as Yamila. We even had some family members come visit in the extra bedroom, which did not have an AC unit but was fine with a fan - at least for the month of June when we were there. Having the second bathroom when we had guests was nice too. I would highly recommend this place for anyone. I appreciated that what you see is what you get. The pictures are exactly what you will see and have in the apartment. No surprises."

Ces points, importants, font en sorte que la location est acceptable. Cependant, les photos donnent une impression plus positive de l'appartement que la réalité; une des deux chambres manquent complètement d'intimité, ce qui pourrait être réglé en faisant transférant cette chambre dans une pièce quasi de rangement qui est inutilisée; l,appartement est vieillot, ce qui pourrait être acceptable, si des efforts étaient consentis pour remplacer tout ce qui est désuet et demande des réparations, somme toute, mineures: rideau de douche à quelques euros, changé de couleur et pas du tout invitant, cafetière à expresso qui a 100 ans...pleins de petits éléments brisés ou pas adéquats: lumière dans l,escalier, bout de plancher brisé, barure de porte brisée. Bref, il y a des limites à vouloir faire de l'argent: quelques centaines d'euros investis rendrait ce logement beaucoup plus acceptable. La dame qui nous a accueillie n'est pas en cause; elle est aimable et l'appartement avait été bien nettoyé, mais reste douteux quand les épouses refusent de prendre une douche parce que le rideau est blanc-brun...Finalement, je crois que AIRBNB n'est pas assez présent dans le rapport avec le locateur: il n'y a pas de standards suffisants pour garantir l'acceptabilité du service. Disons que c'était passable à acceptable, mais d'un point de vue affaire, le service peut être bien amélioré "

Excellent bars and restaurants just around the corner and a good supermarket right in front of the door. Bus/metro stops are very close too. Wifi is great and the apartment is very nicely decorated. Kids (and grandmom) loved the chill out corner downstairs. Communication with Cristina and Yamila was better than I ever would have expected. Great week."

    "comments": "Cristina's home worked perfectly for us. Although it is a relatively small space it felt spacious for the five of us. \r\n\r\nThe entrance is through quite a dark courtyard and arriving late at night it did give us pause. But during the day you realize it's an inner courtyard accessed by several apartments, full mostly with families from what we could see.\r\n\r\nThe kitchen had everything we needed for simple meals, the bathrooms worked perfectly, the little reading nook was a favorite space, and the air conditioning in the two primary bedrooms was appreciated as it was a hot week when we stayed. The middle room with the couch that turns into a bed didn't have air conditioning and it took some thinking to get air flowing through that space.\r\n\r\nWe liked the neighborhood as it feels like it is full of locals, not tourists. There are restaurants all around as well as markets and shops, making it very simple to keep everyone happy with food. The metro and bus stops are within a few blocks and very convenient. Both my sister and I used the bus to go to the airport (40 mins or so), though a taxi from the airport was only about 25 Euro.\r\n\r\nNoise does travel easily from apartment to apartment in the courtyard but I was impressed by how well everyone stuck to the quiet hours. From around 11 at night until around 10 in the morning there was very little noise. \r\n\r\nI would happily stay at Cristina's again, both for the comfort of the apartment and the authenticity of the neighborhood."

Staying at Cristina’s house was the perfect place to explore the city and surrounding area. \r\n\r\nYamila gave very good directions prior to arriving at the house, and additional advice on arriving by public transport to the house. \r\nThe Poble Sec metro station is only 5 minutes away from the house that connects to the airport via the train or you can catch the Eurobus to Espanya. It is only a 10-15 minutes walk away. All very easy.\r\n\r\nThe house was beautiful & everything described in their advert.\r\nIt was situated in a secure gated community with other residents which felt very safe. \r\nIt was clean and easily accommodated 6 adults with plenty of space to sit & relax, both in the house or outside on the downstairs patio or upstairs on the 2 balconies. \r\n\r\nIt was a great base for to discover the city, with all the main shopping areas, museums and cafes in easy access either by walking or by Metro. We tended to walk into the city, and catch the metro back.\r\n\r\nThere was a small supermarket across the road, plus many local shops nearby including butchers, fishmongers, bakery and a 24-hour shop.\r\n\r\nWe had no issues during our stay, but Yamila was easy to communicate with, and responded quickly to confirm our leaving plans. \r\n\r\nWe would fully recommend staying at Cristina’s house.\r\n"

There's a shop right across the street and a larger one around the corner. There is even a pizza place next to it.\n\nIt took us about 45 minutes to get there from the airport, but it's a simple route.\n\nOverall, the apartment is great, the hosts are lovely people and very helpful. We had a blast in Barcelona and we just hope we'll be back soon.\n\nThank you for everything :)"

    "comments": "What a wonderful place!! My family and I (a group of 4) stayed here for a full week in June. At the time, Barcelona was having an unusual heat wave, so Cristina's place ended up being a true oasis for us! Poble Sec is a great neighborhood and allows for easy access to many of the main attractions in Barcelona. We would regularly walk a couple short blocks to the main road, Paral Lel, and easily catch a taxi to the beach or to Oldtown for sightseeing etc. It's possible to walk to many sights, but during the heat wave we had to rely on rides!\nThe house itself was lovely, fully equipped kitchen, two bathrooms and a very comfortable living room. The downstairs patio magically stays cooler than anywhere else outside so we sat there often. Everything was clean and easy to use!\nThere is a wonderful bakery next door that we went to every morning. Two great plazas in either direction a block away for coffees, sandwiches, tapas and drinks. And, there is a market directly across the street so you always have access to necessities. Carrer Blai is a lively street very close by that is buzzing at night with great people watching. This is a fantastic place for pinxtos, with every option you can imagine. This is a great street for lounging with drinks in outdoor seating and seems to be filled with locals and tourists alike.\nCristina was fast with communication and gave lots of information about the house and area. Yamilla helped us check in and out, and was so kind and helpful!! We loved our stay and absolutely recommend staying here while you are in Barcelona!!"

Our host was a total delight - really good at her job!  She met us at the exact appointed times, and I knew that I could count on her if anything went awry.  She was great at providing us with so many useful details about the area and for giving me all the instructions that I needed to cook and do laundry. (I guess I can't get away from that - even on vacation!!!)  \nThe house was super comfortable for me, my husband, and our two teen boys. It was also VERY clean and tidy.  Everyone had their own space - which was a welcome departure from what we experienced in London and Paris.   We did rely on the air conditioning at night. It was pretty hot for us - as we come from Oregon and are not so used to it!  We made good use of the patio, that's for sure!  (Actually, there are three outdoor patios in this home, but the one on the bottom floor, off the kitchen, got the most use by us.)  \nThe baths were great - just fine.  We are a very tall family (all the men are over 6'5\") so it was good to use a shower that they could stand up in!  \nThe kitchen was really great to use and provided everything we needed!  I was so grateful for how thoughtfully everything was provided to us as guests.  \nThe location is ideal - it's just two blocks from the Metro and the neighborhood has all the shops you need for local shopping - a bakery, a butcher, a Super Mercado and tons of cafes.  It's not a touristy location at all - which we loved.   My boys went down to the beach almost every day we were there - to swim, drink beer (and look at the awesome women !!) and my husband and I explored the beautiful streets and art and culture of Barcelona - all within easy reach.  \nWe hope to come back!  We would love to book again and certainly recommend this very nice Pablo-sec apt to friends and family... and anyone reading this review!\nDenise Slattery and Steve Michener\nLake Oswego, Oregon\n"

L'accueil de Xavi a été parfait, c'est une personne chaleureuse, professionnelle  et très ponctuelle! L'appartement a beaucoup de qualité, très bien équipé, grand et propre. Un seul bémol est la pièce principale qui est un peu sombre et sans climatisation, il fait un peu chaud l'été! Cependant les chambres sont climatisées et cela permet de bien dormir, de plus cet appartement est très calme ! Excellent séjour !"

The apartment isn't far to the city center (15/20min by walk) and within walking distance to the main public transport, metro and bus. For those arriving in Barcelona by car, near the apartment (3 minuts by walk) there is a municipal parking named \"Aparcament Municipal Rius and Taulet\". With special rates for 3/5/7 days, during this time you have the opportunity to use the same ticket to park the car in several municipal parking located around the city and close to several turistic attractions: Sagrada Familia, Parc Guell, Barceloneta, etc... Barcelona is great! like its people! Last but not least, Cristina and her assistants are perfect hosts. They are always fast to reply at your  questions and very helpful. Thank you again Cristina."

I appreciated Xavi's availability, recommendations and his kind personality. Location is a bit off the beaten track and it felt really nice to be in a more neighborhood-like location of the city instead of right in the center of all the tourists. Easy access to the metro as well as several bars, restaurants and supermercats. I would definitely recommend Cristina's flat to others visiting Barcelona!"

The apartment was very comfortable with every imaginable amenity, loads of fresh air balconies, comfortable beds, and terrific restaurant recommendations from Cristina. Yamila was a great communicator and met us with keys and all kinds of helpful information. We would highly recommend Cristina's place to families and running groups alike!"

Explore the kitchen cupboards before you shop, as there are quite a few basic items already available! The beds are easy to sleep in and there is plenty of storage place for clothes. The whole apartment is well-kept and scrupulously clean. \n\nOne thing to be aware of is that the walls between houses aren’t very sound-proof, and windows in the neighbourhood are generally kept open, so you will hear some of what’s going on next door. However the whole neighbourhood becomes very quiet in the evening and we had no trouble sleeping. \n\nOverall, a real gem and thoroughly recommended."

La deuxième chambre double est peut être un peu petite mais nous n'étions pas à Barcelone pour rester dans les chambres. Son emplacement en arrière cour en fait un lieu calme, agréable après une journée à courir les rues.

Le quartier est calme, il y a des commerçants juste devant la porte pour les courses. La cours intérieure est typique et adorable, un mix entre la beauté de l'ancien et la simplicité du contemporain. Bref nous avons adoré l'appartement et nous avons été chouchoutée par Yamila et Cristina. Deplus nous avons pu très rapidement rajouter une nuit ( problème avion) car Cristina est ultra réactive.

Aussi une boulangerie, un marchand de fruits et légumes.\n-l'organisation arrivée/départ est parfaitement bien rodée , nous remercions Javier pour son extrême gentillesse et sa grande disponibilité! \nAucun défaut, allez-y les yeux fermés !

Ear plugs were an easy fix for me at night but my husband had a hard time sleeping. Overall nice place to stay though."
