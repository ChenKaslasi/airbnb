He was very accommodating with check-in and check out times. \nOnly downside is that the apartment doesn't have wifi, so perhaps not ideal for business travellers or longer stays. "

The only very small negative we can say is the noisyness at night on the weekend BUT you can pop to the pharmacy next door and pick up some earplugs and that solves the problem!! Absolutely LOVED the location and decor of the apartment. Ben was so easy to communicate with and made sure that we were comfortable and had everything we needed :-) If you stay here, it is well worth looking at Ben's suggestions for top spots in the area. We went down the road to Bourke St Bakery everyday (amazing coffee and food!!) and went to the Italian restaurant Vacanza on our last night-simply delicious! We would 100% stay again on our next visit to Sydney :-)"

I let ben know and he didn't reply. I chased 2 days later and he agreed to come and take a look - afterwards the issue was much worse and the entire floor was covered in water, the shower then also wouldn't turn off. Ben told me he would look into a plumber coming and once again failed to get in touch - I chased and said it was uninhabitable like that .. and Ben then demanded that we leave that very day with no compromise with time to find somewhere else, despite us having 4 nights left and visiting from London. \nAwful experience all around."

The place is small and cozy, nothing more you need for your stay. The TV is a smart TV with the youtube app which (we didnt realize till after staying in our other airbnb's without it) was awesome! \n\nThe only thing is, the bed and the couch kind of sunk in. So we ended up sleeping on the ground. Which honestly isnt bad at all, and made my back feel muuuch better the next day. Honestly didnt detract from the experience at all."

Perhaps having  a hairdryer available would have lightened my luggage! \nCheck in and check out was easy. Ben was available ,approachable and very helpful. \nThe location was perfect for exploring Sydney. A 20 min stroll down historic Oxford St to Darling Harbour. Many different buses right out the front to Centre Point, Bondi, Circular Quay  just to mention a few. Don't forget to get your Opal card from any newsagent and you can top it up with cash on line! Walking distance to the train to explore further a field.\n The studio apartment on the 7th floor has spectacular views ( the photos don't lie!) and is nestled in a friendly community with many restaurants/cafes/shops/chemists all within walking distance. We will be back for many visits I am sure...thanks again Ben!"

          "comments" : "Worst Airbnb experience ever! On arrival, the apartment was quite grubby and full of host's personal possessions with only 2 drawers left for the two of us over a fortnight. The fridge had half empty jars, food stains were all over the cabinet doors, and the place was dusty.\nWe had a disaster in that we accidentally left the keys in the apartment (that locks behind you!). We were unable to contact Ben for over 2 days as he had left the country without informing us - ending with us out on the street for hours, having to stay in a hostel overnight and eventually paying for a locksmith as we desperately needed our belongings. Ben was not even remotely apologetic once he finally got in contact with us. \nOnce we asked him if it was possible for him to reimburse for the locksmith and other costs, he replied aggressively with snarky and unnecessarily nasty comments about our stay - saying we had left wet towels on the floor when actually we had left one wet towel in the laundry basket that we had used to clean the water from the leaking toilet that was a great inconvenience throughout our stay and has been a complaint from another guest. Also said we raked through his personal belongings which were against his 'rules', when actually we only used a couple of towels from a drawer since he only left us one bath towel for two people for a fortnight. Ben has also attempted to charge us 100AUD regarding a small stain on the bed sheet, which is a completely ridiculous price especially considering the fee that we paid for cleaning.\nFurthermore, we asked where he would like his new keys to be left so he could get back in his apartment - to which eventually he said to 'leave them on the kitchen table'. This obviously doesn't make any sense and he only replied a few hours before our departure so we replied we would leave one of the keys in an envelope in his letterbox under his other mail. Only after we requested reimbursement days after we had left, he replied in a hostile manner that he had to pay for his own locksmith as we didn't leave him his key(?). \nOverall a dreadful experience that we wouldn't like anyone else to go through, as leaving the keys in an apartment when the door locks behind your back could essentially happen to anyone. This could have been handled far more efficiently & pleasantly if the host had actually been a decent person so BEWARE."

It was in a perfect location right across from Hyde park. I did not use the pool but the apartment does have a roof top heated pool which looked great. Apartment was clean and the bed was comfy. Desireé was a wonderful host and had some lovely touches such as stocking the fridge with beers and provided snacks, fruit and milk etc. the bathroom was also stocked with products and didn't even need to use my own shampoo etc. We also were allowed an early check in and a late check out which was just amazing. I will be staying here again on my next visit. "

Desireé was exceptionally communicative and helpful, across arrival instructions and helpful hints, to being extremely flexible with my check in and departure times from the property. She was wonderfully generous with items left in the fridge for me to help myself to, and even some lovely fresh flowers for me on arrival. It's a gorgeous apartment right in the hub of the city BUT with the bedroom double glazed I had some of the best nights sleeps here I've had in ages. Terrific stay. Best part? Uber wide screen Tv and free NETFLIX! I loved this apartment. Don't hesitate to book."

A perfectly stocked kitchen and tasty tea made it really homely. It was also spotless clean and the African styled furnishings gave it a memorable touch. The house has friendly reception staff and they were helpful with giving directions. The location is sublime as it overlooks Hyde Park which is really close to both parts of the city centre. We highly recommend the flat and would happily stay again in the future. Thanks!"

The hotel rooms get marked down for being dated in reviews on hotel sites, but this apartment certainly isn't.  It's centrally located: it has Darlinghurst's little strip of restaurants just around the corner, and central Sydney equally close in the other direction.  I was here for a week in March and it (unusually) rained every day, so the 60\" UHD Samsung smart TV with Netflix and Stan (Aussie streaming), as well as Apple TV, was particularly welcome, as was the small gym on the roof.  The pool was less useful, but would be great normally.  Desireé is a very friendly host too.  Highly recommended."

The apartment is tastefully decorated with art and books from adventurous travels; furnished and accessorized with absolutely everything that I could require, plus more. I was impressed at the Desireé's thoughtfulness in accommodating her guests needs. Such things as a kind welcome note. Petite chocolates, mini fresh milk packs in the fridge, expresso machine and every conceivable toiletry item one could need inside a bathroom cabinet. Discreetly rolled up extension cords so you never have to look for one to reach the wall socket to charge your digital devices. The bed was comfortable, where sprigs of fragrant lavender greeted us laid upon freshly rolled up towels. We loved our stay and highly recommend Desireé as a host. She communicated well, was always polite and prompt with messaging all required information upon booking. There's no doubt why Desireé has been voted as a super host. You will be delighted."

There is everything you could want close by, especially restaurants and public transport, the airport train is just a few meters away. The apartment has everything you could possibly need and more. Desiree's interest and love of people shines through in everything she does; she goes way beyond being a superhost.  Thank you Desiree for making our stay so special and we can't wait to come back, hopefully when the weather is a little kinder."

It is smartly decorated with comfortable furniture and lovely modern kitchen and bathroom.  There is a guest laundry in the building with coin operated machines and you can do a big wash and dry for $4 each.  The apartment is bright and airy and has a nice busy city outlook which we enjoyed.  You can certainly hear the buzz of the city around you but you are right in the CBD so that is to be expected and enjoyed.  The location is fantastic.  You can walk to just about everything in the city centre and trains and buses are only metres away if you want to get around more quickly or go further afield.  Very easy access from the airport by train into Museum station. The host, Desiree, was a pleasure to deal with, excellent communication all the way through.  This is a wonderful little home away from home putting you right into centre of the Sydney action."

The unit was close to grocery, public transport and amenities were as if I had lived there.

It' s easy to go anywhere you wish, thanks to the perfect location.\n\nAnd Desireé is a real superhost: Quick to answer my inquiries, she gave me valuable advice during my stay.\n\n I recommend strongly this apartment: You will enjoy even more your stay in Sydney (and won't want to leave...). Many thanks Desireé!"

They had thought of everything, and we really appreciated the homely touches. The bed is very comfy, there is plenty of wardrobe space, and a comfy couch when a night in is in order. Despite the location right near Hyde Park, it is very quiet and we were not bothered by any noise during our stay. Desireé and Julian were lovely hosts and we appreciated the clear directions and easy check-in and check-out. We would love to stay here again when we’re in Sydney again!"

I came for the Sydney Film Festival, and the apartment was well located on Hyde Par, so I could walk to and from the venue. The studio was very comfortable and well stocked too - the little things such as tea, milk, spreads for breakfast etc were thoughtful. Picking up and dropping off the keys were a breeze and whilst I did not meet my host, she was very responsive and helpful. I can highly recommend this place for a city based jaunt. Thanks again Desiree"
