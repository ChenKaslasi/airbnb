The Murphy bed was comfortable, and the AC unit (not pictured) kept it nice and cool.  \r\nAlthough I didn't meet her, she arranged for a neighbor to meet me and show me in. He was cool and so were any other neighbors that I met. \r\nShe also left a list of suggestions where to shop and eat, along with menus which was helpful when I needed a late night meal. \r\nHighly recommended. \r\n"

Apt is close to everything and  the neighborhood has so much to offer. I would definitely recommend Greta's place.  "

The bed is surprisingly comfy and firm (I have never slept in a Murphy bed before) and the shower had plenty of hot water and great pressure. Greta was very communicative and friendly, and was also incredibly accommodating when I had something come up unexpectedly and needed to stay a couple hours longer than I anticipated. Overall all it was a very cozy stay in a great location!"

I would describe the apartment as a very warm, personal, comfortable and homey place to stay. It’s a corner apartment with good light, lots of books and  very good energy. Plus, the beds are quite comfortable. My daughter exclaimed “Hey Dad, come lie down in this one. You’ll never want to get up!”\r\n\r\nThe neighborhood was incredibly well located and enjoyable. The train stops  a half block away, and there are numerous excellent restaurants and conveniences close by. Greta, the host, provides a first-rate list of recommendations.\r\n\r\nGreta was a personable, helpful and extremely welcoming host. She was very quick to respond to my online inquiries and, once we arrived, to any further requests for advice.\r\n"

The Murphy (fold-down) bed has a very thick memory foam mattress that is extremely comfortable.  Samantha (the cat) was a sweet little presence, but she kept mostly to herself so we barely saw her.  The location is great, less than a block to the 1 line, and there are several nice restaurants in the neighborhood.  Finally, Greta herself was a perfect host:  kind but not intrusive, thoughtful in her preparations for guests, and available should any problems arise (though none did).  A great airbnb experience!"

I requested her a really early check in and she agreed (which was helpful because I took a red eye from Seattle). She also allowed me to keep my bags after my check out time so I could pick it up before my flight.\r\nSecond - her apartment location is SUPER convenient. Right next to the #1 and pretty close to B and C lines. NYC is all about location is this fits perfectly.\r\nThird - her apartment gives the feel of a typical NYC apartment. It is tiny but has everything you need. Two beds, a great shower, clean towels, and a kitchen (which I didn't use). Safe building with elevator. \r\n\r\nI would totally stay here again.  "

I was travelling with my soon-to-be 17 year old daughter so she was thrilled to have her own bedroom! This is not fancy accommodation but warm and homey and probably a good representation of how an average New Yorker lives, although I suspect not many are as organized as Greta. Much recommended!"

Greta always replied immediately in the outmost helpful way during preparation and stay. thank you Greta! we will hopefully be back soon :)\n"

The subway entrance close to the apartment was manned and easy to buy and top up your pass, it is the only way to travel around the city. On leaving for the airport, after both our stays we had only to wait a minute on the corner with our luggage to get a taxi to the airport. Once again Greta allowed us to arrive and leave at times that suited us with our luggage which didn't leave us stranded for hours with difficult flight times from Australia which was a great relief, thanks so much Greta!"

We took Lyft around due to my mom's use of a wheelchair in the streets. Drivers made good time to and from lower Manhattan via larger roads. Elevator made it easy to get to and from the 4th floor apartment, and being on the 4th floor removed us from the street a bit. "

          "comments" : "My husband, son and I were fortunate enough to have discovered the Henry Norman Hotel for our recent stay in Greenpoint Brooklyn. Even though we booked our room through Airbnb, we were welcome to all the amenities the hotel had to offer.  We were pleased from our arrival at the hotel, where the exterior was as pretty as the interior and greeted by Robert whose very pleasant demeanor was refreshing.  Each of the staff at the hotel were very professional and accommodating but Robert stood out from the rest.  I was unfortunate enough to have left my phone at a nearby shop after returning via the hotel shuttle, when notifying the front desk to see if I had left my phone in the back seat, Robert quickly responded with his assistance in searching for the item, then driving us immediately to the last location while he assured us he would be outside waiting so we would not have to walk back. I did in fact find my phone at that location (thanks to a good Samaritan) and Robert refused to take compensation for his kindness.  The only thing I would do differently on our next stay is to spend the extra for the room with the patio, as the view from the hotel is quite nice and the breezes up there were wonderful.  We not only will be back to visit the lovely hotel but will gladly recommend it to all who might be vising the Greenpoint area. "

Indeed, because of a flight schedule change, I asked the Airbnb host and the welcome desk of the hotel how I could manage my last night cancellation to be refund. I did exactly what they asked me to do and have been informed two days after that they refused my request of refunding... Despite the policy rules, I found it very dishonest and not correct at all as I have asked them before doing the cancellation on Airbnb and the flight confirmation.\nMoreover, I felt insulted when they made me left the welcome desk to go to the basement in order to let other clients of the hotel believe everything is perfect (I was calm and just trying to solve the issue).\nSo to conclude, the room ok but bad experience in this Airbnb that is an hotel!"
