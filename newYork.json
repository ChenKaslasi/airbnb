I love the arts and have a background in theatre and music- and an interest in writing poetry. Although I dont drink or party, I am known to work it out on the dance floor! I talk on the phone a lot and am a morning gym person.\n\nI grew up in the midwest and have lived in NYC for about 13 years. Ive been in my current (3 bedroom) apartment for about 12 years and have been doing airbnb for about half of that time! I am in my mid 30's, I work from home and enjoy a friendly, clean, peaceful environment.\n\nIf im home, Im often working in my room/home office. From time to time i host small meetings in my room or living room. Guests are welcome to come and go as they please. Since i have 2 rooms on airbnb i just ask folks to be mindful of other people, shared bathroom and kitchen, etc.  Although i dont normally get to spend a lot of time with guests, I truly enjoy meeting new people and it means so much to me for people to enjoy my home. Given the high rate of gentrification where i live, im also happy to share more about local businesses to support that invest in families who have historically lived in this neighborhood.

The apartment had a great kitchen, fully equipped and we sometimes took the dinner with us down to the front stairs on the street. Our room had a small walk-in closet and a bed, we also enjojyed the big living room. Rachael was so sweet. She worked a lot, but we could always ask her about anything. She had a great laughter and we sometimes chit chattet with her in the kitchen. We would definately recommend a stay in this great apartment!"

The 2,3,4,5 trains are only a few minutes walk away so getting into Manhattan is a breeze.\r\nI look forward to staying back with Rachael again whenever I'm next visiting New York."

    "txt": "I really didn't feel that Rachel's room was adequately represented in the listing. It's very much an interior room, not just by a hall and a living room, but also by a staircase, the bathroom and the kitchen. It's in the center of the apartment. The openings are sheet rocked in, so have no insulation. There is no separation from the owner's unit downstairs. What this means is that sound (all sounds, casual sounds, everything)  is completely transparent within the room. I would not recommend for a light sleeper, or for someone who needs to feel a sense of privacy. \r\nI also wrote up front about what I needed. I didn't feel listened to at all. Then I was blamed being for not being up front (apparently because I didn't emphasize that I seriously needed what I needed), and then was also told when I was angry that my communication style is overwhelming. It actually made me feel pretty \"gas lighted.\"\r\nFinally, the apartment is extremely expensive even by NYC standards. My friends who visited me during my month long stay were aghast. They felt that what I was paying for the room was close to what the rent probably was for the whole apartment.\r\n...On the up-side the place is clean, and the neighborhood is great. The landlord downstairs is very nice too. For a few days of visiting if you're not noise sensitive, the apartment could be quite fine if you don't mind the price. "

It's decorated beautifully and she has set aside shelf spaceDesc in the kitchen and bathroom to allow you to really feel at home. The bedroom is very comfortable, with a large closet and dresser to store your things. The bed is soooooo comfortable! I slept like a rock!\r\n\r\nThe apartment is half a block away from great restaurants and groceries on Franklin Ave and a super short walk to the 2, 3, 4, 5, and S trains, and an easy walk to the A and C trains at Fulton and the LIRR stop at Nostrand Ave which I walked to every morning while I was here. Ask Rachael for recommendations on food. She knows her stuff!\r\n\r\nSpeaking of Rachael, she is one of the nicest people you'll meet in New York City. I had a few problems moving in that were entirely my fault, but she was attentive and helpful far exceeding any expectations. She makes you feel welcome and at home from the minute you arrive and she's a joy to chat with when you have a minute.\r\n\r\nI would highly recommend this room to anyone coming to Brooklyn!"

We had everything we needed. Bed was very comfy, we had also plenty of spaceDesc for our stuff - pretty big closet and chest of drawers. Living room and kitchen were available all the time. Our street and  whole neighborhood were really nice with lots of cafe places, restaurants, grocerys and everything you need. The closest subway station is like 5 minutes walking from home.

The room is just like shown in the pictures, very comfortable, quite and cosy, the bed is great, we slept very well! The location is great, with a lot of restaurants, bars and small shops, also very close to some Brooklyn's spots like Botanical Garden, Prospect Park and Brooklyn Museum. The subway is just 5min walking and just 15min to go to Manhattan Downtown. I felt very safe on the neighbourhood, even in late night. \r\nI really enjoyed my stay at Rachael's and highly recommend to all! "

The location is lovely, many cool restaurants, coffee shops on Franklin Av and in the neighborhood.\nThe only thing if I have to mention something negative, would be that at one point we went for about 10 days without cleaning and things started to be not so neat.\nOverall great stay, I would recommend Rachael to anyone."
