    "txt": "We stayed in the brownstone for 4 nights and had a lovely time.  The apartment was spacious enough for us (a family of four) and the location was amazing.  You are steps to Central Park and to the 86th subway.  There are wonderful restaurants and shopping nearby if you need that but the small kitchen is fine for quick snacks and breakfast.  It was especially nice to sit on the little patio to eat my toast and tea and even with the NYC humming around you it is lovely to have an outdoor space.  Chas answered all my many questions with great patience and care...he really wanted us to have a wonderful time and went beyond the call of duty by even sending us links to good places to watch big soccer matches.  The apartment was clean when we arrived and had the basic things we needed such as towels and extra sheets.  While not the cheapest option on BNB it gave us all a wonderful bed to sleep in, space to spread out in when needed, and a fantastic location!  We even found street parking for the full 5 days!  Picking up the keys was a breeze and we left a few basic things for the next guests to enjoy from the corner store.   It is a gorgeous street to stay on and felt very safe. Thank you so much Chas!  We hope to return one day soon."

The location is perfect particularly for those wanting access to Central Park and the museum mile (Guggenheim etc) but it was also a revelation to explore that end of Broadway.  The apartment is lovely and has everything.  We especially appreciated the study nook and ability to use our laptop with wifi access and the well equipped kitchen for easy prep for meals (and deli close by makes it so easy to stock up).  The lounge, bedroom and bathroom are all in good, comfortable condition.  The little balconies and view of the courtyard topped it off.  A great experience and thoroughly recommend."

There are so many details -- from the art on the walls to the spices in the kitchen -- that make it feel like a home away from home. The apartment is small but imminently comfortable with high ceilings and patios that make it feel spacious. The unit is off the street (on a courtyard)  so it was very quiet (that  and the comfortable bed made for great nights of sleeping). It's a beautiful street, just off Central Park and just around the corner from the subway. There are abundant restaurants within a 5 minute walk and the best coffee in NY (Joe's) is only about two blocks away. Chas was a great host who was quick to answer all our questions and make our stay as enjoyable as possible. We had our two sons with us (ages 10 and 12) and the living arrangements were ideal for a family our size. Thanks, Chas!"

The bed was comfortable and the decor made you feel instantly at home.  Wifi was excellent and a decent sized TV with Netflix which we didn't use once because there were more exciting things to do.\r\n\r\nAs mentioned, the apartment block is very quiet ... amazing given how close it is to the main road of restaurants, shops and bars of Bedford Avenue.  \r\n\r\nWe walked around day and night in perfectly safe environment.  We took Ade up on some recommended places to eat and they were all great local places, well researched.\r\n\r\nIt was easy walking distance to all points of interest in Williamsburg, from the vintage market to the regular street food festival and East River Ferry, providing access to other parts of Brooklyn, downtown NYC and Governor's Island.  \r\n\r\nThe short walk to different subways meant getting into the city was very fast, particularly areas such as East Village and Park Slope.  We regularly went from the heart of the city back to the apartment within 20-30 minutes, a good escape when the crowds got too much in  Manhattan.\r\n\r\nAde welcomed in and helped us up with the bags on day 1.  There is no lift but compared to subways, a few flights of stairs was not a problem.  Again, on departure day she was very accommodating letting us leave the bags and helping us with getting them down again."

There's a medium size flat screen TV in the bedroom, with Netflix, and the internet wifi connection, which is immensely important to me as a tech guy on the go, was lightning fast.\r\n\r\nThe building is a little old and unkept, but don't let that scare you - the apartment is in perfect condition. Do be aware that it's on the 4th floor and the stairwell is quite steep, so don't stay here if you have a disability or very small children.\r\n\r\nThe most wonderful thing about the apartment is the neighbourhood. Williamsburg is charming, and there are numerous cafes, bars and restaurants literally a few steps away. I particularly liked \"Samurai Mama\" and \"Snacky\", check them out if you're into Asian food. There's also the Williamsburg Music Hall and the Knitting Factory - well known venues where you can sample the local rock bands. And, importantly, the streets felt to me safe enough to walk around alone at night.\r\n\r\nThe apartment is a few minutes away from the subway station where you can take the L train to Manhattan - a few stations away.\r\n\r\nAde herself was friendly and very helpful. I found her to be the perfect host - responsive enough when I needed her, but she didn't bother me at all when I didn't.\r\n\r\nI travel to NYC a lot, and I will be more than happy to stay at Ade's again next time I get there.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

We're not the type that mind living out of our suitcases, so it didn't necessarily bother us, but I thought it was worth mentioning. \r\n\r\nAde was very quick with her communication, so getting into and checking out of her apartment proved simple and convenient \r\n\r\nI would say this is the perfect place to stay if you want a cute, centrally located Brooklyn home base with easy access to Manhattan and you don't plan on hanging out very much at the apartment... but it's New York, so what the heck are you doing hanging out in an apartment anyway?!?!\r\n"

You find all you need just around the corner, it’s a few blocks from the waterfront, Brooklyn bridge/Dumbo and also to the metro, if you are interested visiting Manhattan it’s just a few minutes with the train. Although it's in a crowded area, it‘s quiet. I totally recommend this apartment , very clean and filled with nice art pieces. Ade was the perfect host, always helpful and she never let me wait at any time. I was very happy being your guest. Thank you Ade!"

    "txt": "Good location at a good price.  The apartment is less than a half a block off of Bedford at a location that has a lot of good local bars and restaurants.  We felt very safe though there is a vacant lot that you could walk by on her street.  However, we did not make much of it, but you could walk on the other side of the street if that bothers you.  The street is well lit.  We worried a little about noise given Williamsburg's reputation for hipness.  However, this ended up not being a problem.  Restaurants were still open after 9, but you could still walk into them without reservations.  At night, it was busy enough to feel safe, but it was sparse enough for it to be farely quiet.\n\nGetting into Manhattan can be an issue.  The L train is the only train coming into the neighborhood.  If it isn't running, the closest stop is Marcy at the end of the Williamsburg bridge which is probably a 30 minute walk.  The ferry, which is a bargain, is close and will cross the East River and drop you off at 34th close to the UN Building.  However, it does not run after 9:30 in the evening.\n\nAde's building is a little ratty which you will see in the stairwell.  However, her apartment is perfectly fine.  The bed is comfortable which is nice compared to most Air BNB hosts.  There is a window unit AC for the entire apartment.  Depending on the time of year, I am not sure if it will cool the bedroom well since it's in a different part of the apartment (though there is an oscillating fan there).  We did not have a problem since it was October.  There is no microwave oven.  It is four flights up with pretty large stairs and no elevator.  I would avoid this apartment if you are elderly or handicapped.\n\nWe did not meet Ade which it is getting pretty common not to meet the host.  However, we had no problems.  The process to get the key was easy.  She had recommendations printed and posted in the room, and she was quick to respond to questions by messaging.\n\nFor our purposes, this was a great place to consider if the L train is running.  We would not stay her again if the L train isn't running.  However, if you don't mind working around the ferry schedule and you want to visit Williamsburg and Greenpoint, this will work well for you."

We are located very close to 7th Avenue, which has all kinds of shopping. There are fine groceries such as Union Market, several good delis, some of the best bagels in New York at the Bagel Hole,etc., as well as restaurants with food from every corner of the globe, ranging from higher end fare at places like Talde to our local diner located right on the corner of the block.  Many fine coffee shops, bars and stores of every description are also only a short walk away, as is Prospect Park (located two blocks away) with its many wide open spaces and forest paths, where you can forget for a while that you are in a big city.",

The G train does not go into Manhattan but offers easy access to Brooklyn’s Williamsburg neighborhood and locations in Queens.  BUSES The 67 and 69 buses run along 7th avenue, and the 61 bus that runs along 9th street is also very close.  TAXI There are often green or yellow NYC taxis around. The green taxis work the same as the yellow but are designated specifically to stop in Brooklyn and boroughs other than Manhattan. There are many car services in the neighborhood as well (we’ve had pretty good luck with Eastern). PARKING There is free parking on the numbered streets and metered parking on 7th Avenue. Read signs carefully for street cleaning rules.  CAR RENTAL There are many Zipcar locati",

It's also on the first floor, which is nice if you have heavy suitcases (it gets difficult lugging stuff up three flights of stairs). Even though it's on street level, the street is a quiet / residential one, and the entrance is some distance from the sidewalk—so noise is not an issue. There are very nice restaurants and cafes less than a block or two away. Ildiko went the extra mile in stocking the apartment with essential items, including a fully stocked first-aid kit(!). Although I had office space in Manhattan, I spent all of my time working from home, because I didn't want to leave the house or this neighborhood. Prospect Park is also very close, which makes for a nice place to go for a walk and clear the mind. Definitely one of the nicest and most pleasant airbnb experiences I've had so far!"

We had two people staying here - the bed and pull-out were both very comfortable and Ildiko made sure to get everything ready for our arrival (which was late at night, but she was amazingly accommodating and lives on the premises so can easily be reached).  The neighborhood is lovely - a short walk to Prospect Park and plenty to do on 7th avenue.  There is a subway stop nearby.  It was also nice to find a ground floor listing!

The truly wonderful music venue Barbes (our main reason for choosing this location), the F & G subway lines (get you to most places you would want to be), and Prospect Park all within a few minutes walk. The apartment has a great collection of books and CDs, which we highly appreciated, plus a nice outside space. The only thing we would have liked is more than just one towel each for a 9-night stay, particular given the lack of a washing machine/dryer. Communication was a little bit patchy, with access to the property only organised at the very last moment (whilst we were on a transatlantic flight), but ended up being fine. Without doubt would stay again."

Easy access (no need to schlep suitcases up flights of stairs). Mattress is firm - fine with me but a matter of personal taste. It's queen size and there is a futon if you have a kid or friend along.  In summer there is a garden in the rear that would be a pleasant place to enjoy the outdoors in the heart of Brooklyn but away from the hustle and bustle. Numerous shops, delis, restaurants, coffee shops, and groceries within a short walk. We didn't use the TV or sound system (there is a library of CDs) but might do so on another visit -  they are a great amenity, as is the library of books on music and art."

    "txt": "I can't say enough about this place--it is the perfect size for a couple or small family. Ildiko was so nice and helpful and we really felt welcome. She was responsive to questions and the check-in was really easy. The bathroom was sparkling clean and has been newly renovated, and the kitchen/dining area was large enough to cook in and not feel cramped. There is a lovely garden in the back which we were told we could use but it was really hot when we were there so we didn't take advantage of that (but it looked really nice and peaceful). For location, you can't get much better than Park Slope! It's just a few blocks from the F/G or a short walk to the R line. There are tons of restaurants and shops nearby and it's a 5-10 minute walk to Prospect Park. This space is so inviting and comfortable, it was the perfect place to come back to at the end of a busy day touring the city. And you can't beat the price! We highly recommend and would definitely book again. "

It’s a garden apartment on a quiet side street, with excellent natural light from the terrace-view windows, nicely decorated, in a convenient Park Slope location (shops and trains right around the corner), and close to fabulous restaurants such as Camperdown Elm and Piccoli Cafe. Idilko is friendly, communicative and helpful, and the apartment has a great selection of maps for exploring the area, books and music for R&R.  I enjoyed the firm mattress, down pillows and soft cotton sheets, and a super-clean, spacious full bath was another plus. It was the ideal place for my stay in Brooklyn – thank you, Idilko!\n"

Visiting my daughter twice a year, I am used to Park Slope area and can confirm that we couldn't expect a better place at this rate.\nIdiko was out of town but the check-in instructions were very clear. She was available if needed and was  enough accomodating for the check-out so everything went smoothly.\nThe apartment is spacious, functional and plenty of natural light. It is very convenient as well: all kinds of stores, markets, restaurants, subway stations are within walking distance. Prospect Park is two blocks away.\nThe kitchen is very well-equipped,  just perfect for cooking! I truly felt like a home away from home as well as saving money.\nI highly recommend Ildiko's place and would definitely plan on staying here again."

I talk on the phone a lot and am a morning gym person.\n\nI grew up in the midwest and have lived in NYC for about 13 years. Ive been in my current (3 bedroom) apartment for about 12 years and have been doing airbnb for about half of that time! I am in my mid 30's, I work from home and enjoy a friendly, clean, peaceful environment.\n\nIf im home, Im often working in my room/home office. From time to time i host small meetings in my room or living room. Guests are welcome to come and go as they please. Since i have 2 rooms on airbnb i just ask folks to be mindful of other people, shared bathroom and kitchen, etc.  Although i dont normally get to spend a lot of time with guests, I truly enjoy meeting new people and it means so much to me for people to enjoy my home. Given the high rate of gentrification where i live, im also happy to share more about local businesses to support that invest in families who have historically lived in this neighborhood.

    "txt": "I really didn't feel that Rachel's room was adequately represented in the listing. It's very much an interior room, not just by a hall and a living room, but also by a staircase, the bathroom and the kitchen. It's in the center of the apartment. The openings are sheet rocked in, so have no insulation. There is no separation from the owner's unit downstairs. What this means is that sound (all sounds, casual sounds, everything)  is completely transparent within the room. I would not recommend for a light sleeper, or for someone who needs to feel a sense of privacy. \r\nI also wrote up front about what I needed. I didn't feel listened to at all. Then I was blamed being for not being up front (apparently because I didn't emphasize that I seriously needed what I needed), and then was also told when I was angry that my communication style is overwhelming. It actually made me feel pretty \"gas lighted.\"\r\nFinally, the apartment is extremely expensive even by NYC standards. My friends who visited me during my month long stay were aghast. They felt that what I was paying for the room was close to what the rent probably was for the whole apartment.\r\n...On the up-side the place is clean, and the neighborhood is great. The landlord downstairs is very nice too. For a few days of visiting if you're not noise sensitive, the apartment could be quite fine if you don't mind the price. "

Ask Rachael for recommendations on food. She knows her stuff!\r\n\r\nSpeaking of Rachael, she is one of the nicest people you'll meet in New York City.

We had everything we needed. Bed was very comfy, we had also plenty of space for our stuff - pretty big closet and chest of drawers. Living room and kitchen were available all the time. Our street and  whole neighborhood were really nice with lots of cafe places, restaurants, grocerys and everything you need. The closest subway station is like 5 minutes walking from home.

    "txt": "I loved my experience staying with Rachael. I stayed with her for a month and she made my transition so much easier. The apartment is super cute and very cozy. She pays very close attention to detail and had so many things available for me that I had forgotten at home. The location was great. There were a lot of restaurants in the general vicinity and the train was a short walk away. She was extremely accommodating and would always ask me if I needed anything. When I go back to Brooklyn I will definitely be staying with her again! Thank you Rachael for an amazing stay!"
